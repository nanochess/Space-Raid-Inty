The following files are provided:

  exp2.asm    Space Raid (exp2 because it was experiment 2)

  e.sh        Assemble game (*nix)
  e2.sh       Assemble game and launch debugger (*nix)

I developed this code in a time where I didn't intend to publish source code, so I wrote all comments in Spanish, I intend to translate it later to English but my free time is scarce.

Assemble with as1600 from http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/
Tested with jzintv and Nostalgia emulators
Tested with real Intellivision using Cuttle Cart 3 and LTO-Flash.
